This project implements an algorithmic trading strategy using Python.

## Dependencies

To run the code, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or above
- Pandas (version 1.0.0 or above)
- NumPy (version 1.18.0 or above)
- Matplotlib (version 3.1.0 or above)
- <additional dependencies>

You can install the dependencies by running the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Setup Instructions
Open your Command Prompt and follow the above steps

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/satya-1974/Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy-01.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Algorithmic-Trading-Strategy-01

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python3 -m venv env

4.Activate the virtual environment:

For windows:
.\env\Scripts\activate

For Mac:
source env/bin/activate

5. Install the dependencies:
